It started with me wondering about wave–particle duality. I was working through Spivak's treatment of limits and the graph of f(x) = x sin(1/x), and the oscillatory-yet-convergent behavior reminded me of the photon's dual nature. I asked myself: what would have to be true for a photon to behave as both a wave and a particle? At some point it occurred to me to ask, what if it were actually two massive objects in orbit at a scale beyond our ability to measure? Their helical orbit would trace a wave pattern from the side while remaining particle-like head-on. 

I recalled that probing the Planck length with light would require wavelengths so energetic they'd collapse into a black hole — so I imagined a sub-Planckian binary system of singularities.

The question then became: what would have to be self-consistent for that picture to work? How small would those singularities have to be, and what constraints would the framework need to satisfy? 

Over about three days of iterative computation, the framework converged on a self-consistent BCC lattice structure that derives both α⁻¹ and m_p/m_e from the integer 8 and π to sub-ppb accuracy against CODATA 2018 values.

The physical picture is still not clear but the predictive accuracy prompts me to seek input.
